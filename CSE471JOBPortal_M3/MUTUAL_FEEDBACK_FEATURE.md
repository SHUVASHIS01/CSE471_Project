# Mutual Anonymous Feedback Feature

## Overview
This feature implements a mutual anonymous feedback system where recruiters and applicants must both provide feedback before application decisions (Accepted/Rejected) and reviews become visible. This ensures transparency and accountability in the recruitment process.

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Recruiter-Initiated Review (Mandatory)
- When a recruiter changes application status to **Accepted** or **Rejected**, they must submit anonymous feedback first
- The feedback form is shown as a modal before status change is finalized
- Application result remains locked for the applicant until both parties submit feedback

### 2. Locked Notification for Applicant
- After recruiter submits feedback, applicant receives notification
- Application decision and recruiter review remain hidden (locked)
- Applicant sees a "Status Locked" message with option to submit feedback

### 3. Applicant Feedback to Unlock Status
- Applicant must submit anonymous feedback to unlock the application status
- After submission, applicant can view:
  - Application decision (Accepted / Rejected)
  - Recruiter's anonymous review

### 4. Feedback Visibility
- Recruiters receive notification when applicant feedback is submitted
- Both parties can view each other's feedback anonymously
- No personal identities are revealed
